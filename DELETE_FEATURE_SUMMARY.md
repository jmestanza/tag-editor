# Delete Image Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a delete image feature that removes images from the database, MinIO storage (including thumbnails), and all associated annotations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Endpoint (`/api/images/delete/route.ts`)

- **New file**: `tag-editor-app/src/app/api/images/delete/route.ts`
- **Method**: DELETE
- **Parameters**: Image ID via query parameter (`?id=123`)
- **Functionality**:
  - Validates image ID
  - Retrieves image details from database
  - Deletes main image file from MinIO storage
  - Deletes thumbnail from MinIO storage
  - Removes all associated annotations (via cascade delete)
  - Removes image record from database
  - Returns success/error response

### 2. Enhanced ImageViewer Component

- **File**: `tag-editor-app/src/app/components/ImageViewer.tsx`
- **New Props**:
  - `onImageDeleted?: () => void` - Callback for parent component notification
- **New State**:
  - `isDeleting: boolean` - Loading state for delete operation
  - `showDeleteDialog: boolean` - Controls delete confirmation dialog
- **New Features**:
  - Delete button in main image view (next to Edit button)
  - Delete button in modal edit view
  - Confirmation dialog with detailed information about what will be deleted
  - Loading states during deletion
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Enhanced DatasetViewer Component

- **File**: `tag-editor-app/src/app/components/DatasetViewer.tsx`
- **New Function**: `handleImageDeleted()`
  - Updates local dataset state by removing deleted image
  - Adjusts current image index appropriately
  - Handles edge cases (empty dataset, index out of bounds)
- **Enhanced UI**:
  - Shows "No images in dataset" message when all images are deleted
  - Provides upload button for empty datasets
  - Proper navigation handling when images are removed

## Key Features

### Delete Confirmation Dialog

- Shows image filename
- Lists what will be deleted:
  - Image file and thumbnail from storage
  - All annotations for the image
  - Database record
- Clear warning that action cannot be undone
- Loading state during deletion

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of MinIO deletion failures (logs warnings but continues)
- Database transaction safety
- User-friendly error messages
- Network error handling

### UI/UX Improvements

- Delete buttons with trash icon for clear intent
- Consistent styling with existing design
- Proper loading states and disabled button handling
- Responsive design considerations

### State Management

- Proper cleanup of local state after deletion
- Automatic navigation to next available image
- Graceful handling of empty dataset state
- Maintains gallery pagination

## Testing Considerations

- Test deletion of images with and without thumbnails
- Test deletion of last image in dataset
- Test deletion with network failures
- Test concurrent deletions
- Test permissions and authentication (if applicable)

## Security Notes

- Image ID validation prevents injection attacks
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Database cascade deletes ensure data consistency
- MinIO deletion is non-blocking to prevent hanging operations

## Future Enhancements

- Batch delete functionality
- Undo/restore capability (with trash/recycle bin)
- Delete confirmation via modal instead of confirm dialog
- Progress indicators for large file deletions
- Audit logging for deletion operations
