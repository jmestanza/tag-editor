# Dataset Merge Progress Bar Implementation

## Overview

Added a real-time progress bar to the dataset merge process with detailed progress tracking and user feedback.

## Components

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `/api/datasets/merge-progress/route.ts`

- In-memory progress tracking system
- GET endpoint to retrieve merge progress
- Helper functions for managing progress state
- Automatic cleanup after 5 minutes

#### 2. `/api/datasets/merge/route.ts`

- Integrated progress tracking throughout merge process
- Added mergeId generation and return to frontend
- Progress updates for:
  - Category processing
  - Image file copying
  - Annotation processing
- Error handling with progress cleanup
- Completion status tracking

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. `DatasetMerge.tsx`

- Added progress polling with useEffect hook
- New progress bar UI with:
  - Visual progress bar (percentage)
  - Current operation description
  - Step counter (current/total)
  - Error/warning display
- Updated step indicators (1: Select, 2: Configure, 3: Merge, 4: Complete)
- Real-time progress updates during merge process

## Features

### Progress Tracking

- **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion
- **Operation Status**: Displays current merge operation
- **Step Counter**: Shows current step out of total steps
- **Error Handling**: Displays warnings and errors during merge
- **Real-time Updates**: Polls backend every second for updates

### User Experience

- **4-Step Process**: Clear progression through merge steps
- **Responsive Design**: Progress bar scales with content
- **Error Recovery**: Shows errors but continues processing when possible
- **Completion Feedback**: Clear success/failure indication

## Technical Details

### Progress Calculation

- Total operations = categories + images + annotations + setup steps
- Progress percentage = (current operation / total operations) \* 100
- Real-time updates every 1000ms (1 second)

### Memory Management

- In-memory storage for active merge progress
- Automatic cleanup after 5 minutes
- Cleanup on both success and failure

### Error Handling

- Non-blocking errors are collected and displayed as warnings
- Critical errors stop the merge and show failure state
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Usage

1. User selects datasets to merge (Step 1)
2. User configures merge settings (Step 2)
3. Merge process runs with real-time progress (Step 3)
4. Results and statistics displayed (Step 4)

The progress bar provides visual feedback during the potentially long-running merge operation, improving user experience and reducing uncertainty about the process status.
