# Annotation Loss Debugging Fix

## üîç **Problem Identified:**

Annotations were being silently lost during dataset merging due to missing category mappings, with no error reporting or visibility into what was happening.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented:**

### 1. **Enhanced Error Tracking**

- Added comprehensive annotation copy result tracking
- Detailed error messages for missing category mappings
- Console logging for debugging category mapping issues

### 2. **Annotation Copy Statistics**

New statistics now tracked and displayed:

- **Annotations Copied**: Successfully copied annotations
- **Annotation Failures**: Failed annotation copies with error details
- **Annotations Skipped**: Annotations skipped due to missing category mappings

### 3. **Detailed Error Reporting**

- **Console Logging**: Shows available category mappings when lookup fails
- **Error Collection**: All annotation errors are collected and returned
- **UI Display**: Annotation errors are now visible in the merge results

### 4. **Root Cause Detection**

The enhanced logging will now show:

- Which annotation failed to copy
- What category mapping was expected vs. available
- Specific error messages for each failed annotation

## üéØ **What This Solves:**

### Before:

- Annotations silently disappeared
- No visibility into what went wrong
- No way to debug category mapping issues

### After:

- Clear error messages when annotations can't be copied
- Detailed statistics showing annotation copy success/failure rates
- Console logs for debugging category mapping issues
- UI display of all annotation-related errors

## üîß **How to Use:**

1. **Run a merge operation** with your datasets
2. **Check the merge results** for annotation statistics
3. **Look for annotation errors** in the results display
4. **Check browser console** for detailed debugging information

### Example Error Messages:

```
No category mapping found for annotation 123 (category 5) in dataset 2 for image photo.jpg
Available category mappings: 1:1, 1:2, 2:3, 2:4
Looking for key: 2:5
```

This will help identify:

- Missing categories in the target dataset
- Category mapping generation issues
- Specific annotations that are being lost

## üß™ **Testing:**

1. Create two datasets with some shared images
2. Add annotations to images in both datasets
3. Use different category merge strategies
4. Check the merge results for annotation copy statistics
5. Review any annotation errors in the results

The enhanced logging and error reporting will now make it clear exactly why annotations are being lost and provide the information needed to fix the underlying issue!
