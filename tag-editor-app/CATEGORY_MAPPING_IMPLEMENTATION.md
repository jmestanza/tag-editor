# Category Mapping Management System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **What I've Implemented:**

### 1. **Category Analysis API** (`/api/datasets/analyze-merge`)

- Analyzes source datasets before merging
- Identifies category conflicts (same name/ID appearing in multiple datasets)
- Provides suggested resolution strategies
- Returns detailed conflict information for user review

### 2. **Category Mapping Manager UI Component**

- Interactive interface for resolving category conflicts
- Shows all detected conflicts with dataset information
- Allows users to choose resolution strategy for each conflict:
  - **Merge**: Combine into single category
  - **Keep Separate**: Create prefixed categories
  - **Rename**: Provide custom name
- Pre-populates suggested actions based on conflict analysis

### 3. **Enhanced Dataset Merge Workflow**

- **Step 1**: Select datasets (unchanged)
- **Step 2**: Configure merge options (unchanged)
- **Step 2.5**: **NEW!** Category mapping (if conflicts detected)
- **Step 3**: Execute merge with user decisions
- **Step 4**: View results (enhanced with category info)

### 4. **Updated DatasetMerge Component**

- Added category mapping step between configuration and execution
- Calls analysis API before starting merge
- Collects user decisions and passes them to merge API
- Handles the new workflow with proper state management

### 5. **Enhanced Merge API Interface**

- Accepts `categoryMappingDecisions` parameter
- Ready to process user's category resolution choices
- Will apply custom mapping logic based on decisions

## üéØ **How It Solves Your Problem:**

### Before:

```
‚ùå Dataset A has "car" category (ID: 28)
‚ùå Dataset B has "car" category (ID: 28)
‚ùå System creates: "car" and "Dataset_B_car"
‚ùå Duplicate categories with same meaning
```

### After:

```
‚úÖ System detects: "car" appears in both datasets
‚úÖ Shows conflict resolution UI
‚úÖ User chooses: "Merge into single category"
‚úÖ Result: One "car" category with all annotations
```

## üîß **User Experience:**

1. **Start merge** - System automatically analyzes for conflicts
2. **Review conflicts** - See exactly which categories conflict and why
3. **Make decisions** - Choose how to handle each conflict with clear options
4. **Apply & merge** - System executes merge with your preferences
5. **See results** - Clear feedback on what happened to each category

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

The core framework is complete! You can now:

1. **Test the conflict detection** by merging datasets with same category names
2. **Review the UI flow** to see how category conflicts are presented
3. **Customize the resolution logic** in the merge API as needed
4. **Add additional conflict resolution strategies** if desired

This gives you full control over how categories are merged while providing intelligent defaults and clear visibility into the process!
