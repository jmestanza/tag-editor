# UI Update Summary: Dataset Merge Duplicate Handling

## âœ… **What was added to the UI:**

### 1. **New Radio Button Option**

Added "Keep best annotated" as a 4th option in the Duplicate Image Handling section:

- **Skip duplicates** - Keep first occurrence, skip subsequent ones
- **Rename duplicates** - Add suffix to filename (e.g., image_1.jpg, image_2.jpg)
- **Overwrite duplicates** - Replace existing files with new ones
- **Keep best annotated** âœ¨ **NEW!** - Automatically select the version with most annotations

### 2. **Enhanced Results Display**

Added comprehensive duplicate warnings display in the merge results:

- **Duplicate Images Count** - Shows total number of duplicate images found
- **Detailed Duplicate List** - Expandable section showing:
  - File name of each duplicate
  - Which datasets contained the duplicate
  - Which version was selected and why
  - Visual indicators with icons and color coding

### 3. **Type Safety Updates**

- Updated TypeScript interfaces to include new option
- Added `duplicateWarnings` and `duplicateImagesFound` to response types
- Ensured all form handlers support the new option

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Features:**

### Visual Design

- Blue color scheme for duplicate warnings (distinct from errors/warnings)
- Collapsible sections for better space management
- Icons and visual indicators for easy scanning
- Responsive grid layout for statistics

### Information Display

Each duplicate warning shows:

```
ðŸ“„ filename.jpg
Found in 3 datasets: Dataset A, Dataset B, Dataset C
âœ“ Selected from Dataset B (8 annotations)
```

### User Experience

- Clear, descriptive labels for each option
- Helper text explaining what each option does
- Visual feedback showing duplicate resolution results
- Easy-to-scan statistics grid

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

1. **Frontend (DatasetMerge.tsx)**

   - Added new radio option with proper TypeScript typing
   - Enhanced MergeResult interface with duplicate warnings
   - Added duplicate warnings display component
   - Updated all onChange handlers

2. **Backend (route.ts)**
   - Added `"keep_best_annotated"` to handleDuplicateImages type
   - Implemented smart selection algorithm
   - Added comprehensive duplicate tracking and warnings
   - Returns detailed duplicate information in response

## ðŸ§ª **Testing:**

To test the new feature:

1. Create datasets with duplicate image filenames but different annotation counts
2. Select "Keep best annotated" option in the merge UI
3. Run the merge
4. View the results to see:
   - Which duplicates were found
   - Which versions were selected
   - Why each version was chosen

The UI now provides full visibility into duplicate handling decisions and allows users to choose the optimal strategy for their specific use case!
